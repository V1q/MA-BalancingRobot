Hello!

All source files for my Coocox project for stm32f4discovery board are placed here.
The project I am working currently on is construction of balancing robot.
Multiple peripherials are used in this project, so this can be good source of examples for beginners and more advanced programmers. 

List below shows what hardware I am / will be using : 
	- STM32F4DISCOVERY
	- KAMODBTM222 <-- Bluetooth module from Polish shop Kamami.pl
	- MODMPU6050 <--- Inertial Measurement Unit based on MPU6050 by InvenSense, also bought in Kamami
	- H - bridges made by myself based on LM6203 full DMOS bridges

Fell free to ask me for any technical and related to programming stm32f4 details. Find contact e-mail on my git user page.
